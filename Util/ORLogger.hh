//! Logging class to be used by OrcaROOT
/*!
    This class defines how to use output.  
    Usage is as follows:

    \verbatim
    ORLog(kDebug) << "This is a message" << std::endl; 

    ORLogger::SetSeverity( kDebug );  // Or some other severity
    ORLogger::SetOStream( &std::cout );  // Or some other ostream
    \endverbatim

    The logging class will pipe this to the correct output if the 
    current severity is set to above the passed-in severity.

    This class handles threads by assigning each thread it's own OStream.
    By default, this first thread to use ORLog will get the cout ostream 
    and all other threads will be piped to null output.  To avoid this, call
    ORLogger::SetOStream in each thread with a unique ostream for 
    each thread.
